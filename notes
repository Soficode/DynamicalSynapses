Dynamical Synapses transform matrices to antisymmetric matrices, which are non normal. (they oscillate - but still driven by main eigenvalue?).
Now, it is left tocheck whether and in what conditions these non-normal matrices are unitarily equivalent to a delay line: it seems like as long as they are not nomral -- which assymetric arent? -- then they will be 

and talk about FMC why not necessary -- rather focus on input stats


Also, test  whether with different input connectivity and statistics you get orthogonal matrices --maybe that would require learning?

explore different time scales and tm 

extra matrix

write up

no much change with non-linearity
